If you have an account on ada.tamu.edu, you can scp CUDA dir to ada. 
 
 $scp CUDA YOUR_NETID@ada1.tamu.edu:

Notice that only 5 login nodes (ada1, ada2, ..., ada5) on Ada are 
equipped with either one or two K20s. You can check them with 

 $nvidia-smi

Then you can 

1. load CUDA module.

 $ml CUDA

2. compile the CUDA code you are working on.

 $cd hello_world 
 $nvcc hello_world_device.cu

3. submit a job to run the CUDA code in a GUP node 
   You may need to modify the job script ada_cuda_run.sh accordingly.

 $bsub < ada_cuda_run.sh

Good luck!
